# Linux-specific Runtime Configuration

## Namespaces

A namespace wraps a global system resource in an abstraction that makes it appear to the processes within the namespace that they have their own isolated instance of the global resource.
Changes to the global resource are visible to other processes that are members of the namespace, but are invisible to other processes.
For more information, see [the man page](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html).

Namespaces are specified as an array of entries inside the `namespaces` root field.
The following parameters can be specified to setup namespaces:

* **`type`** *(string, required)* - namespace type. The following namespaces types are supported:
    * **`pid`** processes inside the container will only be able to see other processes inside the same container
    * **`network`** the container will have its own network stack
    * **`mount`** the container will have an isolated mount table
    * **`ipc`** processes inside the container will only be able to communicate to other processes inside the same container via system level IPC
    * **`uts`** the container will be able to have its own hostname and domain name
    * **`user`** the container will be able to remap user and group IDs from the host to local users and groups within the container

* **`path`** *(string, optional)* - path to namespace file

If a path is specified, that particular file is used to join that type of namespace.
Also, when a path is specified, a runtime MUST assume that the setup for that particular namespace has already been done and error out if the config specifies anything else related to that namespace.

###### Example

```json
    "namespaces": [
        {
            "type": "pid",
            "path": "/proc/1234/ns/pid"
        },
        {
            "type": "network",
            "path": "/var/run/netns/neta"
        },
        {
            "type": "mount"
        },
        {
            "type": "ipc"
        },
        {
            "type": "uts"
        },
        {
            "type": "user"
        }
    ]
```

## Devices

`devices` is an array specifying the list of devices to be created in the container.

The following parameters can be specified:

* **`type`** *(char, required)* - type of device: `c`, `b`, `u` or `p`. More info in `man mknod`.

* **`path`** *(string, optional)* - full path to device inside container

* **`major, minor`** *(int64, required)* - major, minor numbers for device. More info in `man mknod`. There is a special value: `-1`, which means `*` for `device` cgroup setup.

* **`permissions`** *(string, optional)* - cgroup permissions for device. A composition of `r` (*read*), `w` (*write*), and `m` (*mknod*).

* **`fileMode`** *(uint32, optional)* - file mode for device file

* **`uid`** *(uint32, optional)* - uid of device owner

* **`gid`** *(uint32, optional)* - gid of device owner

**`fileMode`**, **`uid`** and **`gid`** are required if **`path`** is given and are otherwise not allowed.

            "uid": 0,
            "gid": 0
        }
    ]
```

## Control groups

Also known as cgroups, they are used to restrict resource usage for a container and handle device access.
cgroups provide controls to restrict cpu, memory, IO, pids and network for the container.
For more information, see the [kernel cgroups documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroups/cgroups.txt).

The path to the cgroups can be specified in the Spec via `cgroupsPath`.
`cgroupsPath` is expected to be relative to the cgroups mount point.
If not specified, cgroups will be created under '/'.
Implementations of the Spec can choose to name cgroups in any manner.
The Spec does not include naming schema for cgroups.
The Spec does not support [split hierarchy](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroups/unified-hierarchy.txt).
The cgroups will be created if they don't exist.

```json
   "cgroupsPath": "/myRuntime/myContainer"
```

`cgroupsPath` can be used to either control the cgroups hierarchy for containers or to run a new process in an existing container.

You can configure a container's cgroups via the `resources` field of the Linux configuration.
Do not specify `resources` unless limits have to be updated.
For example, to run a new process in an existing container without updating limits, `resources` need not be specified.

#### Disable out-of-memory killer

`disableOOMKiller` contains a boolean (`true` or `false`) that enables or disables the Out of Memory killer for a cgroup.
If enabled (`false`), tasks that attempt to consume more memory than they are allowed are immediately killed by the OOM killer.
The OOM killer is enabled by default in every cgroup using the `memory` subsystem.
To disable it, specify a value of `true`.
For more information, see [the memory cgroup man page](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroups/memory.txt).

* **`disableOOMKiller`** *(bool, optional)* - enables or disables the OOM killer

###### Example

```json
    "disableOOMKiller": false
```

#### Set oom_score_adj

More information on `oom_score_adj` available [here](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt).

```json
    "oomScoreAdj": 0
```

#### Memory

`memory` represents the cgroup subsystem `memory` and it's used to set limits on the container's memory usage.
For more information, see [the memory cgroup man page](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroups/memory.txt).

The following parameters can be specified to setup the controller:

For more information, see [the cpusets cgroup man page](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroups/cpusets.txt).

The following parameters can be specified to setup the controller:

* **`shares`** *(uint64, optional)* - specifies a relative share of CPU time available to the tasks in a cgroup

* **`quota`** *(uint64, optional)* - specifies the total amount of time in microseconds for which all tasks in a cgroup can run during one period (as defined by **`period`** below)

* **`period`** *(uint64, optional)* - specifies a period of time in microseconds for how regularly a cgroup's access to CPU resources should be reallocated (CFS scheduler only)

* **`realtimeRuntime`** *(uint64, optional)* - specifies a period of time in microseconds for the longest continuous period in which the tasks in a cgroup have access to CPU resources

#### Block IO Controller

`blockIO` represents the cgroup subsystem `blkio` which implements the block io controller.
For more information, see [the kernel cgroups documentation about blkio](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroups/blkio-controller.txt).

The following parameters can be specified to setup the controller:

* **`blkioWeight`** *(uint16, optional)* - specifies per-cgroup weight. This is default weight of the group on all devices until and unless overridden by per-device rules. The range is from 10 to 1000.

## Rlimits

rlimits allow setting resource limits.
`type` is a string with a value from those defined in [the man page](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setrlimit.2.html).
The kernel enforces the `soft` limit for a resource while the `hard` limit acts as a ceiling for that value that could be set by an unprivileged process.

###### Example

```json
   "rlimits": [
        {
            "type": "RLIMIT_NPROC",
