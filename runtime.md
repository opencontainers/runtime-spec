# Runtime and Lifecycle

## State

Runtime MUST store container metadata on disk so that external tools can consume and act on this information.
It is recommended that this data be stored in a temporary filesystem so that it can be removed on a system reboot.
On Linux/Unix based systems the metadata MUST be stored under `/run/opencontainer/containers`.
For non-Linux/Unix based systems the location of the root metadata directory is currently undefined.
Within that directory there MUST be one directory for each container created, where the name of the directory MUST be the ID of the container.
For example: for a Linux container with an ID of `173975398351`, there will be a corresponding directory: `/run/opencontainer/containers/173975398351`.
Within each container's directory, there MUST be a JSON encoded file called `state.json` that contains the runtime state of the container.
For example: `/run/opencontainer/containers/173975398351/state.json`.

The `state.json` file MUST contain all of the following properties:

* **`version`**: (string) is the OCF specification version used when creating the container.
* **`id`**: (string) is the container's ID.
This MUST be unique across all containers on this host.
There is no requirement that it be unique across hosts.
The ID is provided in the state because hooks will be executed with the state as the payload.
This allows the hooks to perform cleanup and teardown logic after the runtime destroys its own state.
* **`pid`**: (int) is the ID of the main process within the container, as seen by the host.
* **`bundlePath`**: (string) is the absolute path to the container's bundle directory.
This is provided so that consumers can find the container's configuration and root filesystem on the host.

* **`annotations`**: (interface) holds runtime-specified information that is not structured by this specification.
The runtime could store experimental information here before it's standardized in this specification.

*Example*

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "id": "oc-container",
    "pid": 4422,
    "bundlePath": "/containers/redis"
}
```

## Lifecycle
The lifecycle describes the timeline of events that happen from when a container is created to when it ceases to exist.

1. OCI compliant runtime is invoked by passing the bundle path as argument.
2. The container's runtime environment is created according to the configuration in [`config.json`](config.md).
   Any updates to `config.json` after container is running do not affect the container.
3. The container's state.json file is written to the filesystem.
4. The prestart hooks are invoked by the runtime.
   If any prestart hook fails, then the container is stopped and the lifecycle continues at step 8.
5. The user specified process is executed in the container.
6. The poststart hooks are invoked by the runtime.
   If any poststart hook fails, then the container is stopped and the lifecycle continues at step 8.
7. Additional actions such as pausing the container, resuming the container or signaling the container may be performed using the runtime interface.
   The container could also error out or crash.
8. The container is destroyed by undoing the steps performed during create phase (step 2).
9. The poststop hooks are invoked by the runtime and errors, if any, are logged.
10. The state.json file associated with the container is removed and the return code of the container's user specified process is returned or logged.

Note: The lifecycle is a WIP and it will evolve as we have more use cases and more information on the viability of a separate create phase.
