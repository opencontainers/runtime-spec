# Runtime and Lifecycle

## State

The runtime state for a container is persisted on disk so that external tools can consume and act on this information.
The runtime state is stored in a JSON encoded file.
It is recommended that this file is stored in a temporary filesystem so that it can be removed on a system reboot.
On Linux based systems the state information should be stored in `/run/opencontainer/containers`.
The directory structure for a container is `/run/opencontainer/containers/<containerID>/state.json`.
By providing a default location that container state is stored external applications can find all containers running on a system.

* **version** (string) is the OCI specification version used when creating the container.
* **id** (string) is the container's ID.
* **pid** (int) is the ID of the main process within the container.
* **root** (string) is the path to the container's bundle directory.

The ID is provided in the state because hooks will be executed with the state as the payload.
This allows the hook to perform clean and teardown logic after the runtime destroys its own state.

The root directory to the bundle is provided in the state so that consumers can find the container's configuration and rootfs where it is located on the host's filesystem.

*Example*

```json
{
    "id": "oc-container",
    "pid": 4422,
    "root": "/containers/redis"
}
```

## Lifecycle

### Create

Creates the container: file system, namespaces, cgroups, capabilities.

### Start (process)

Runs a process in a container.
Can be invoked several times.

### Stop (process)

Not sure we need that from runc cli.
Process is killed from the outside.

This event needs to be captured by runc to run onstop event handlers.

## Hooks

See [runtime configuration for hooks](./runtime-config.md)
