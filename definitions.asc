In the specifications in the above table of contents, the keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in {rfc2119}[RFC 2119] (Bradner, S., "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels", BCP 14, RFC 2119, March 1997).

The keywords "unspecified", "undefined", and "implementation-defined" are to be interpreted as described in the {c99-unspecified}[rationale for the C99 standard].

An implementation is not compliant for a given CPU architecture if it fails to satisfy one or more of the MUST, REQUIRED, or SHALL requirements for the protocols it implements.
An implementation is compliant for a given CPU architecture if it satisfies all the MUST, REQUIRED, and SHALL requirements for the protocols it implements.

[[bundle-definition,bundle]] bundle::
  A <<bundle,directory structure>> that is written ahead of time, distributed, and used to seed the runtime for creating a <<container>> and launching a process within it.

[[config-definition,configuration]] configuration::
  The <<config,`config.json`>> file in a <<bundle-definition>> which defines the intended <<container>> and container process.

[[container,container]] container::
  An environment for executing processes with configurable isolation and resource limitations.
  For example, namespaces, resource limits, and mounts are all part of the container environment.

[[container-namespace,container namespace]] container namespace::
  On Linux, a leaf in the {namespaces-7}[namespace] hierarchy in which the <<process,configured process>> executes.

[[json,JSON]] JSON::
  All configuration {json}[JSON] MUST be encoded in {utf-8}[UTF-8].
  JSON objects MUST NOT include duplicate names.
  The order of entries in JSON objects is not significant.

[[runtime-definition,runtime]] runtime::
  An implementation of this specification.
  It reads the <<config-definition>> from a <<bundle-definition>>, uses that information to create a <<container>>, launches a process inside the container, and performs other <<runtime,lifecycle actions>>.

[[runtime-namespace,runtime namespace]] runtime namespace::
  On Linux, a leaf in the {namespaces-7}[namespace] hierarchy from which the <<runtime-definition>> process is executed.
  New <<container-namespace,container namespaces>> will be created as children of the runtime namespaces.
