File descriptors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, only the `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` file descriptors are kept open for the application by the runtime.
The runtime MAY pass additional file descriptors to the application to support features such as {socket-activation}[socket activation].
Some of the file descriptors MAY be redirected to `/dev/null` even though they are open.

Dev symbolic links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the container has `/proc` mounted, the following standard symlinks MUST be setup within `/dev/` for the IO.
