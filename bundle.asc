Filesystem Bundle

:os-x-bundle: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_%28OS_X%29

This section defines a format for encoding a container as a _filesystem bundle_ - a set of files organized in a certain way, and containing all the necessary data and metadata for any compliant runtime to perform all standard operations against it.
See also {os-x-bundle}[OS X application bundles] for a similar use of the term _bundle_.

The definition of a bundle is only concerned with how a container, and its configuration data, are stored on a local filesystem so that it can be consumed by a compliant runtime.

A Standard Container bundle contains all the information needed to load and run a container.
This MUST include the following artifacts:

1. `config.json`: contains configuration data.
   This REQUIRED file MUST reside in the root of the bundle directory and MUST be named `config.json`.
   See <<config>> for more details.

2. A directory representing the root filesystem of the container.
   While the name of this REQUIRED directory may be arbitrary, users should consider using a conventional name, such as `rootfs`.
   This directory MUST be referenced from within the `config.json` file.

While these artifacts MUST all be present in a single directory on the local filesystem, that directory itself is not part of the bundle.
In other words, a tar archive of a _bundle_ will have these artifacts at the root of the archive, not nested within a top-level directory.
