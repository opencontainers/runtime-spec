Use Cases
---------

To provide context for users the following section gives example use cases for each part of the spec.

Application Bundle Builders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Application bundle builders can create a <<bundle>> directory that includes all of the files required for launching an application as a container.
The bundle contains an OCI <<config,configuration>> where the builder can specify host-independent details such as <<process.args,which executable to launch>> and host-specific settings such as <<mounts>>, <<hooks>>, <<linux-namespaces>> and <<cgroups>>.
Because the configuration includes host-specific settings, application bundle directories copied between two hosts may require configuration adjustments.

Hook Developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<<hooks,Hook>> developers can extend the functionality of an OCI-compliant runtime by hooking into a container's <<lifecycle,lifecycle>> with an external application.
Example use cases include sophisticated network configuration, volume garbage collection, etc.

Runtime Developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Runtime developers can build runtime implementations that run OCI-compliant bundles and container configuration, containing low-level OS and host specific details, on a particular platform.
